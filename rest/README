* A poor mans REST server
This is a partial implementing of the BioGRID REST service documented
at: http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/biogridrest

* Install
Copy files in this rest diroctory to someplace that will execute CGI
files, something link:

$ sudo mkdir /usr/lib/cgi-bin/rest
$ sudo cp ./rest/* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/rest

** Create Database
Get the latest BIOGRID-ALL.*.tab2.zip file from:
http://thebiogrid.org/download.php

Create the database, if you downloaded BIOGRID-ALL-3.1.93.tab2.zip
create the database using:

$ time unzip -pq $HOME/Downloads/BIOGRID-ALL-3.1.93.tab2.zip  | ./mksql.pl | sqlite3 /dev/shm/biogrid-3.1.93

Then copy and rename it to the same directory you put the CGI files:

$ cp /dev/shm/biogrid-3.1.93 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/rest/biogrid

** Edit ../config.json
Change the entries labeled "interactions" and "version" to point to
the CGI files:

 "interactions":"/cgi-bin/rest/interactions.cgi?",
 "version":"/cgi-bin/rest/version.cgi",
